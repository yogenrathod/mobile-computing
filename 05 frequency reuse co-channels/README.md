The virtual lab is a MHRD, Govt. of India initiative. The objective is to make available the component or features or elements of lab based learning through the internet to the students & practicing engineers who may be in the remotest corner of the world (exp-India) but has at least access to the internet. The aim is to improve the quality of education for students attending courses with limited exposure to laboratory experiments to supplement theory classes. The experiments being developed can be used by a teacher to learn as well as compile a lab course or use as supplementary aid by selecting a combination of experiments from different virtual labs.
This particular lab is titled “Fading Channels and Mobile Communications Virtual lab” which was launched on 26th June 2011.
